Real-Time Object Detection
📖 Overview

This project is a real-time object detection system built using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It allows detection of multiple objects from a webcam feed or video file, drawing bounding boxes and labels in real time.

The system leverages pre-trained models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), TensorFlow Object Detection API, or OpenCV DNN modules (depending on your implementation) to achieve high accuracy and fast inference speeds.

✨ Features

🔍 Detects multiple objects simultaneously in real-time

📸 Works with live webcam or pre-recorded videos

📦 Bounding boxes with object labels and confidence scores

⚡ Optimized for speed (real-time FPS)

🎥 Option to save processed video with detections

⚙️ Installation
1. Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/sanjaykumar258/real_time_object_detection.git
cd real_time_object_detection

2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


(Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and pip installed)

🚀 Usage
Run Detection with Webcam
python detect.py --source 0

Run Detection on a Video
python detect.py --source path_to_video.mp4

Optional Parameters

--threshold 0.5 → Confidence threshold (default: 0.5)

--save → Save output video with detections

--model model/yolov5s.pt → Path to model weights

🧠 How It Works

Frame Capture: Video frames are captured from webcam or input video.

Preprocessing: Each frame is resized and normalized.

Model Inference: Pre-trained model (YOLO/TensorFlow/SSD) predicts bounding boxes and class labels.

Postprocessing: Bounding boxes are drawn with labels and confidence scores.

Display/Save: Annotated frames are shown in real-time and optionally saved.

📦 Models & Frameworks

YOLO (You Only Look Once) – Fast, one-stage object detection framework

OpenCV – For video capture, drawing boxes, and real-time rendering

TensorFlow / PyTorch – For deep learning model loading and inference

🎯 Future Improvements

Add multi-object tracking (DeepSORT integration)

Deploy on cloud or edge devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano)

Optimize inference with TensorRT or ONNX Runtime

Support for custom-trained models
